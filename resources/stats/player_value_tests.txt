So far, it's (.25 * J) + (65.5 * K).

I is some multiple of 16.  A crippling injury took a dragoran (avatar) from 80 to 64 (0x50 to 0x40) with -20 RF, -20 DA.  This looks like it initially corresponds to value (10K is 16 or 0x10, 20K is 32 or 0x20, and so on), but changes as the players get more advanced.  Perhaps this tracks what it should be, or what's displayed? In the player's profile, the value is tinted negatively when I represents a value below JK (and shows it as 1K less), and positively when I represents a value higher than JK (even though the displayed number doesn't change).

For completely new players, J is multiples of 39 (0x27).
